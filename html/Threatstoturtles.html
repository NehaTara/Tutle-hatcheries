                        FISHING ACTIVITIES
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Threat: Turtles are seriously endangered by tangling in nets used for fishing, a condition known as accidental capture. Turtles can be caught in fishing nets and drown if they can't get to the surface for oxygen. As they struggle to escape the nets, ensnared turtles could also sustain wounds or amputations. The likelihood of turtle entanglement and death is increased by the widespread usage of fishing equipment and the use of improper fishing techniques.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Consequences: Fishing nets have detrimental effects on turtle populations. Significant population reductions in turtle species can occur as a result of high bycatch rates in fishing operations. Reduced nesting and hatchling survival rates can result from populations' reproductive capabilities being disrupted by the loss of mature turtles. The ongoing entanglement of turtles in fishing nets adds to the extinction of turtle species that are already endangered or threatened and seriously jeopardizes their long-term existence.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Prevent: Important steps include requiring the use of <a href="https://conserveturtles.org/information-sea-turtles-threats-commercial-trawl-fishing/">Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs)</a>  in fishing nets to allow turtles to escape, promoting substitute turtle-friendly fishing equipment and practices, educating and instructing fishermen on turtle preservation and ethical fishing techniques, and carrying out laws that safeguard turtles and punish violations. These preventative measures are intended to lessen turtle accidental capture, protect populations, and aid in the turtles' longevity in the waters.

                        CLIMATE CHANGE
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Threat: Turtles and their habitats are being threatened by climate change. The gender ratios of hatchlings may shift as a result of changing nesting beach temperatures brought on by rising global temperatures. In addition, storms with greater frequency and ferocity as well as rising sea levels can destroy turtle nesting beaches and interfere with their regular nesting cycles. The accessibility of food supplies, migratory patterns, and the well-being of the ecosystem as a whole can all be impacted by changes in ocean currents and <a href="https://climatefactchecks.org/sea-turtles-in-sri-lanka-and-how-does-global-climate-change-impact-them/#:~:text=Tons%20of%20plastic%20pellets%20from,used%20so%20willingly%20were%20polluted.">temperature.</a> 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Consequences: The consequences of climate change on turtles are far-reaching. Altered nesting beach conditions can affect hatchling survival rates and lead to imbalanced gender ratios, potentially jeopardizing the long-term sustainability of turtle populations. Changes in ocean circulation and temperature can affect the supply and spread of prey, resulting in starvation and decreased reproductive success for turtles. Rising sea levels can result in the loss of nesting grounds.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Prevent: Collective global actions are needed to prevent climate change and its effects on turtles. By switching to greener energy sources, encouraging energy efficiency, and implementing sustainable behaviors, this can be accomplished. For turtles to survive, it is essential to preserve and replenish vital habitats including seagrass beds, mangroves, and nesting beaches. Supporting international climate change agreements and legislation, supporting education on sustainable behaviors, and bringing attention to the effects of climate change on turtle populations are crucial first steps.

                        POLLUTION
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Threat: Turtles are seriously at risk from pollution. Their habitats and food sources are polluted by marine pollution like oil spills and plastic waste. Plastic bags and other waste are frequently mistaken for food by turtles, which can result in entanglement and consumption. For turtles, this pollution can result in physical injury, digestive problems, internal injuries, and even death.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Consequences: Pollution has serious negative effects on turtle populations. Their digestive tracts could become blocked if they ingest plastic trash, which would cause malnutrition and famine. Fishing nets and other trash entanglements can result in injuries, amputations, or drowning. They may become more vulnerable to illnesses and reproductive problems as a result of the buildup of contaminants in their bodies, which can also impair their immune systems.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Prevent: For the preservation and welfare of turtles, pollution prevention is essential. This can be accomplished by educating the public about the detrimental impacts of pollution on turtles and encouraging safe waste disposal methods.Helping and organising beach <a href="https://www.volunteerworld.com/en/volunteer-abroad/sea-turtle-sri-lanka">clean-ups</a> help keep the beaches out of trash.The <a href="../html/Kosgoda.html">kosgoda</a> and <a href="../html/Bentota.html">bentota</a> turtle hatcheries conduct these beach clean-ups as well. Single-use plastic reduction, effective waste management system implementation, promoting sustainable fishing methods, and aiding cleanup activities are all necessary steps. By taking these preventative measures, we can improve the environment, lessen pollution in turtle habitats, and make sure that these lovely creatures will survive for a very long time.
